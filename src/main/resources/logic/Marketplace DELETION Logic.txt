-- MARKETPLACE Logic for DELETION

-- !!!! ON DELETE CASCADE is for MySQL to delete the child row when parent row  is deleted
-- !!!! @OneToMany(mappedBy = "parent", cascade = CascadeType.REMOVE) is used for Spring Data JPA also the same logic in mysql ON DELETE CASCADE

-- if USER is deleted SHOP, PRODUCT-ORDER, and CART, Delivery Address will also be deleted // OK

-- if SHOP is deleted PRODUCT will be deleted (all child will be deleted) // OK

-- if CART is deleted CART-ITEMS will be deleted (child deletion) // OK

// MOSTLY USE LOGIC 
-- if PRODUCT is deleted PRODUCT-ORDER-ITEM and CART-ITEM is deleted (child deletion) // OK

-- if PRODUCT-ORDER is deleted PRODUCT-ORDER-ITEMS is deleted (child deletion) // OK

-- if PRODUCT-ORDER-ITEM is deleted PRODUCT-ORDER is also deleted // OK


-- if CART-ITEM is deleted ok lng // OK

// SHOULD NOT BE DELETED!!!
-- Any deletion NAME-SUFFIX, CROP-UNIT, PRODUCT-TRANSACTION, and CROP should not be affected of deletion
